### Federal funds rate 

target rate that fed advises commerical and investment banks aim for

### Inter-bank overnight interest rates

the actual rate that banks use when making overnight loans (exactly what the sound like) to other banks, banks make overnight loans to eachother to fill reserve deficits (banks were required, but are no longer required, to keep a minimum of 10% of depositors cash on hand)

### Treasury yield curve

the various interest rates offered by government bonds, bonds being basically highly standardized discretely packaged loans, a healthy curve is upward sloping, but steeper for the shorter term bonds and more gradual for longer term bonds, and unhealthy curve is a flat or inverted one, where higher rates are given for shorter term bonds, long term bonds have lower yield when lots of entities are buying government bonds directly from the goverment, indicating that the buying parties anticipate long term gross underperformace of assets which traditionally give high returns in ponzi market conditions (stocks, ETFs, index funds, etc), that is, they would rather have their money in bonds than stocks and related products because stocks will have enormous negative returns while bonds will have small negative returns (because inflation rate is greater than bond yield)

### Repurchase operation

when a financial institution buys government securities like bonds (in the form of a short term loan) from another financial institution (often overnight but sometimes longer periods like days or weeks) to give them the necessary liquidity (cash) to meet financial obligations like interest, principal, and reserve requirements

### Quantitative Easing

federal reserve buys back us government bonds from financial institutions to inject liquidity (add cash) so they can either meet their financial obligations like paying interest and principal or for reallocating that cash into stuff like ETFs and stocks in order to further pump the ponzi

Liquidity injection

adding cash
