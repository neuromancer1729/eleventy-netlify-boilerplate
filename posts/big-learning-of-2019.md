## Take it slow

Don't rush into decisions

take your time to arrive at conclusions.

It is okay to not have an opinion on all things,

it is okay to say, i don't know

## Find your music

to optimise for time spent in state of flow, 

it is important to find the tune to reasonate with in daily activities.

## Doing good at scale

I elaborate on this deeply in my post Crony Capitalism \[WIP]

## Limits of rationality

Rationality isn't fit to make all decisions of life

just like money isn't the solution to solve all your problems

but just like how money will solve your money problems, 

rationality will solve your rational problems

which is not everything but also not nothing.

Avoid sloppy thinking with the same reverance that you would avoid poverty.
